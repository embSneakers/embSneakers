# The Sneakers Project

This is the repository for the paper _"Using Web Data to Reveal 22-Year History of Sneaker Designs"_ submittted to **The Web Conference (WWW) 2022**.

### Data Description [(Data Link)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dYP4AFXGo_35-OS2yeRHeI4ZD_uFcPW_?usp=sharing)

#### 1. Overview
```
- We have crawled sneaker images and metadata from _StockX,_ a leading online resale shop at global scale.
- Total number of sneaker products crawled: 23,492 (see Table 1 for basic statistics)
- Due to the copyright issue, we cannot provide the original sneaker images.
- We share the data for our embedding results, SOTA embedding, and various engineered feature along with the crawled metadata
- See Section 2 for the details of each dataset.

#### 2. Dataset Description
```
df_512_mask_shape_210927.csv:
- Constructed embedding for the latent shape-invariant representation (top module in Figure 1)
- i.e., Color embedding

df_512_mask_color_210927.csv:
- Constructed embedding for the latent color-invariant representation (middle module in Figure 1)
- i.e., Shape embedding

df_512_mask_all_210927.csv:
- Constructed embedding for the latent all-invariant representation (top module in Figure 1)
- i.e., Combined embedding

df_384_looc.csv:
- Constructed embedding for the Leave-one-out Contrastive Learning (LooC)
- We consider this one as SOTA and compare our model with this one (Xiao et al, ICLR 2021)

#### 4. Additional Result

Below, we attach additional clustering results for the _combined embedding_, which were excluded from the manuscript due to page limit.
