# The Sneakers Project

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This repository is for the paper _"Using Web Data to Reveal 22-Year History of Sneaker Designs"_ submittted to **The Web Conference (WWW) 2022**.

### Data Description [(Data Link)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dYP4AFXGo_35-OS2yeRHeI4ZD_uFcPW_?usp=sharing)

#### 1. Overview
```
- We have crawled sneaker images and metadata from StockX, a leading online resale shop at global scale.
- Total number of sneaker products crawled: 23,492 (see Table 1 for basic statistics)
- Due to the copyright issue, we cannot provide the original sneaker images. Visit the link to find sneaker images: https://stockx.com/
- We share the data for our embedding results, SOTA embedding, and various engineered feature along with the crawled metadata.
- See Section 2 for the details of each dataset provided via the link.
```

#### 2. Dataset Description
```
A. df_512_mask_shape_210927.csv:
- Color embedding: Constructed embedding for the latent shape-invariant representation (top module in Figure 1)
- Columns: 1) 0 ~ 511: 512 dimensional (D) embedding features; 2) 512: product ID; 3) 513 ~ 612: 100D metadata features

B. df_512_mask_color_210927.csv:
- Shape embedding: Constructed embedding for the latent color-invariant representation (middle module in Figure 1)
- Columns: 1) 0 ~ 511: 512D embedding features; 2) 512: product ID; 3) 513 ~ 612: 100D metadata features

C. df_512_mask_all_210927.csv:
- Combined embedding: Constructed embedding for the latent all-invariant representation (bottom module in Figure 1)
- Columns: 1) 0 ~ 511: 512D embedding features; 2) 512: product ID; 3) 513 ~ 612: 100D metadata features

D. df_384_looc.csv:
- Constructed embedding for the Leave-one-out Contrastive Learning (LooC)
- We consider this one as SOTA and compare our model with this one (Xiao et al, ICLR 2021)
- Columns: 1) 0 ~ 383: 384D embedding features; 2) 384: product ID; 3) 385 ~ 484: 100D metadata features

E. total_df_RGBHSV_ent_seg_rgbHistBin128_meta.pkl:
- Features from the feature engineering (see the manuscript for more detailed description)
- Columns: 1) 0: product ID; 2) 1 ~ 12: 12D color distribution parameters (mean, std) for RGB, HSV; 3) 13 ~ 19: 7D color entropy features for RGB, HSV, Grayscale; 4) 20 ~ 24: 5D image segmentation features; 5) 25 ~ 408: 384D color histogram of 128 bins for RGB; 6) 409 ~ 508: 100D metadata features

F. val_sneakers_df.pkl:
- Metadata crawled from StockX.com.
- Columns: 1) 0: pid (product ID), you can crawl the same sneaker images as we did by using this ID; 2) 1 ~ 100: a total of 100 metadata features including product name, retail price, colorway, release date, primary category, consumer type, and so on.

#### 3. Code Description
```
A. sneaker_embedding_masked_three_heads.ipynb (see in embSneakers/code/ in the repository):
- Since sneaker images cannot be provided, you cannot construct embeddings from the given codes.
- Rather, please refer to the codes to understand how the embeddings are constructed in details.

B. classification_and_regression.ipynb (see in embSneakers/code/ in the repository):
- From the code, you can run classification and regression tasks by inputting the provided embedding datasets (three from our model, one from SOTA).
- Kinds of inference tasks: 1) Classifications for Primary Category (8 classes), Consumer Type (5 classes), and Maximum Resale Premium (2 classes); 2) Regression for Maximum Resale Premium
- Kinds of inference model: 1) Multinomial Logistic Regression; 2) XGBoost; 3) Multi-layered Perceptron (MLP, a Neural-net method)
```

#### 4. Additional Results

Below, we attach additional clustering results for the _combined embedding_, which were excluded from the manuscript due to page limit.
