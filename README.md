# The Sneakers Project

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This repository is for the paper _"Using Web Data to Reveal 22-Year History of Sneaker Designs"_ submittted to **The Web Conference (WWW) 2022**.

### Data Description [(Data Link)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dYP4AFXGo_35-OS2yeRHeI4ZD_uFcPW_?usp=sharing)

#### 1. Overview
```
- We have crawled sneaker images and metadata from StockX, a leading online resale shop at global scale.
- Total number of sneaker products crawled: 23,492 (see Table 1 for basic statistics)
- Due to the copyright issue, we cannot provide the original sneaker images. Visit the link to find sneaker images: https://stockx.com/
- We share the data for our embedding results, SOTA embedding, and various engineered feature along with the crawled metadata.
- See Section 2 for the details of each dataset provided via the link.

D. df_384_looc.csv (211.9MB):
- Constructed embedding for the Leave-one-out Contrastive Learning (LooC)
- We consider this one as SOTA and compare our model with this one (Xiao et al, ICLR 2021)
- Columns: 1) 0 ~ 383: 384D embedding features; 2) 384: product ID; 3) 385 ~ 484: 100D metadata features

E. total_df_RGBHSV_ent_seg_rgbHistBin128_meta.pkl (108.6MB):
- Features from the feature engineering (see the manuscript for more detailed description)
- Columns: 1) 0: product ID; 2) 1 ~ 12: 12D color distribution parameters (mean, std) for RGB, HSV; 3) 13 ~ 19: 7D color entropy features for RGB, HSV, Grayscale; 4) 20 ~ 24: 5D image segmentation features; 5) 25 ~ 408: 384D color histogram of 128 bins for RGB; 6) 409 ~ 508: 100D metadata features

F. val_sneakers_df.pkl (42.8MB):
- Metadata crawled from StockX.com
- Share downloadable links ("imageUrl") for the sneaker image samples of the current study: see "crawling_source.ipynb" for downloading the images via the links.
- Columns: 1) 0: pid (product ID), you can crawl the same sneaker images as we did by using this ID; 2) 1 ~ 100: a total of 100 metadata features, e.g., product name, retail price, colorway, release date, primary category, consumer type, and so on; 3) 101: imageUrl, downloadable links for the target sneaker images

G. resale_transactions_ALL.csv (1.68GB):
- Containing ALL resale transactions for the target sneaker products, from 2012Q2 to 2020Q3
- Columns: 1) quarter_sold; 2) month_sold; 3) original_resalePrice; 4) inflated_resalePrice: we compute adjusted (inflated) retail or resale price by following the process described in Figure 2; 5) original_retailPrice; 6) inflated_retailPrice; 7) original_profit; 8) inflated_profit, 9) date_of_release: sneaker release date; 10) image_fileName: pid

#### 3. Code Description
```
A. sneaker_embedding_masked_three_heads.ipynb (see in embSneakers/code/ in the repository):
- Since sneaker images cannot be provided, you cannot construct embeddings from the given codes.
- Rather, please refer to the codes to understand how the embeddings are constructed in details.

B. classification_and_regression.ipynb (see in embSneakers/code/ in the repository):
- From the code, you can run classification and regression tasks by inputting the provided embedding datasets (three from our model, one from SOTA).
- Kinds of inference tasks: 1) Classifications for Primary Category (8 classes), Consumer Type (5 classes), and Maximum Resale Premium (2 classes); 2) Regression for Maximum Resale Premium
- Kinds of inference model: 1) Multinomial Logistic Regression; 2) XGBoost; 3) Multi-layered Perceptron (MLP, a Neural-net method)

C. crawling_source.ipynb (see in embSneakers/code/ in the repository):
- From the code, you can automatically download sneaker images that have been sampled for the current work via the links from the metadata: see the last column "imageUrl" in "val_sneakers_df.pkl"
- You only need to run "Crawling by imageUrl" section if you properly download "val_sneakers_df.pkl"; "RAW Crawling source (Using Selenium, Chromdriver)" section in used only for crawling from the scratch
```

#### 4. Additional Results

Below, we attach additional clustering results for the _combined embedding_, which were excluded from the manuscript due to page limit.
